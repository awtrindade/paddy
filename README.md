# [The Remote Manifesto](http://remotemanifesto.com)

This repo is a snapshot of the working repo for my blog. Mainly because no one wants to see my crazy post revisions.

I am [@Paddy](https://twitter.com/Paddy "Follow me on Twitter"). I write about design, the web, travel, climbing and language learning.
